# rbtree
This is a derivation from what appears to be an original work
in 2008 by Derrick Coetzee. The references seem to be no longer valid.

In 2017 I wanted an implementation in C of a red-black tree that was
stand-alone and lightweight. I found this, in several versions, and each
almost fit the bill but not quite.

I have merged bits and pieces and then added my own pieces and the result is
under the original MIT license.
